# Generated Plots

This folder contains all the visualizations and plots generated by the analysis scripts.

## Files

### `my_scatter_plot.png`

- **Generated by**: `data_visualization/plots.py`
- **Content**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between hours coding and number of bugs
- **Features**: Purple markers, grid lines, labeled axes
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI

### `bug_histogram_with_kde.png`

- **Generated by**: `data_visualization/frequency_dist_table.py`
- **Content**: Histogram of bug frequency with overlaid Kernel Density Estimation curve
- **Features**: 10-bin intervals, sky blue bars with black edges, smooth KDE curve
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI

### `my_histogram.png`

- **Content**: Basic histogram of the data (likely generated by a previous version of the analysis)
- **Resolution**: High quality

### `grouped_bug_histogram_with_normal_curve.png`

- **Content**: Histogram with normal distribution curve overlay
- **Features**: Shows how well the data fits a normal distribution
- **Resolution**: High quality

## Usage

These plots are automatically generated when running the visualization scripts. They provide visual insights into:

- The relationship between coding hours and bugs
- The distribution of bug counts
- How well the data fits statistical distributions

## Regeneration

To regenerate these plots, run the corresponding scripts from the `data_visualization/` folder.
